I started by looking at the demo files that openjscad.xyz provides. I found the dodecahedron to be particularly interesting, so I looked into whether there was already a known dodecahedron fractal. It turns out that the Sierpinski triangle fractal can also be applied in a similar manner to a dodecahedron. With this concept in mind, I took the provided demo code and used it to construct a class that could be used to produce a dodecahedron at any size and position.
